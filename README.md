# Colour Palette

## Objectives
- [x] Built with HTML, CSS & JS
- [x] Code hosted on GitHub
- [x] Deployed to GitHub Pages
- [x] Auto-generate multiple colours
- [ ] Allow users to change each colour

## Initial thoughts
Rendering the page layout should be straightforwards: 
- 4-5 `<div>` elements holding information on each colour swatch
- Use of the <kbd> <br> Spacebar <br> </kbd> to generate multiple hex code colours
- One button to copy a colour's hex code
- Functionality to allow users to change each individual colour's hex code

To generate multiple hex code colours, the colour palette will need to incorporate a method such as `math.floor(math.random())`. I envisage assigning these randomly generated colours to the div elements, which will update each time the user presses the <kbd> <br> Spacebar <br> </kbd>.
